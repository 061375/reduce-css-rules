version 1.1 July 26, 2017
- Tested code fixed bugs
- made ajax more dynamic 
- ajax added ability to send multi-dimensional array in POST
- POST data is parsed before send
- program runs onload with php url specified in init
- added PHP to set and get data and stylesheet in location (folder based on current domain)
- stylesheet are sotered and combined

version 1.0 July 26, 2017
- At this point I haven't tested this code at all. I simply wrote out exactly what I thought it would need. Although, fromexperience I am sure (with a few bugs here and there) that it will do what I want it to do.
- The next step is to write a simple PHP handler to store the results as JSON and CSS
